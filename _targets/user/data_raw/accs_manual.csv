Coryphopteris_nipponica,NA,NA,NA,LC484386,NA,NA,NA,from Susan Fawcett 2022-03-29: The type of Coryphopteris nipponica is from Japan and is likely a true Coryphopteris; however material from China that is superficially quite similar has also been treated in this taxon but is most closely related to Amauropelta beddomei (based on our nuclear analyses of such material). JN 2022-05-23: choose only C. nipponica available on GenBank from Japan
