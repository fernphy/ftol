Species Tree
================

The species tree includes one sample per species.

The current species tree includes 4,496 tips (**Fig. 1**).

Overall coverage (percent of species in the tree out of all accepted
species) is 36% (**Fig. 2**). Coverage by major clade (order or
suborder; taxonomy follows [Pteridophyte Phylogeny
Group 2016](https://doi.org/10.1111/jse.12229)) varies from 18%
(Saccolomatineae) to 61% (Salviniales). Larger clades tend to have lower
coverage, with the exception of Pteridineae (50% of 1,532 accepted
names).

**Figure 1: Fern tree of life (FTOL) based on plastid data.** Colors
correspond to major clade (order or suborder, see **Fig. 2** for
labels). Shading on tree indicates geologic era (Cenozoic not labeled).

species in tree out of all accepted species); numbers next to bars
indicate the total number of accepted species in each major clade.
